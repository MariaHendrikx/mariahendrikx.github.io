Rhythm in music is basically just the timing of notes in relation to the tempo. Some say metrum,\r\n      music-direction, music-feeling, .. are also part of the rhythm, but in music, it’s difficult to say what a term\r\n      exactly means, since there are many definitions… When RedAndWhite Apps talks about rhythm, the duration of the notes\r\n      is meant. The other elements, such as metrum, music-direction, … are seen as other elements of music, but not as a\r\n      sub-category of rhythm. Music just doesn’t exist only by melody, rhythm, pitch, … There are so many elements to take\r\n      in consideration, that it’s impossible to describe music by only 3-4 “main”-elements. There are some elements in\r\n      music that are dependent on other elements though, such as metrum… metrum (the accent-placement in music) can only\r\n      exist if there is rhythm. Since the metrum tells which counts to accentuate. But if there is no rhythm to\r\n      accentuate… there is no rhythm nor metrum.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Time Signature</h2>\r\n    <p>To visualize this metrum, a system has been create. Firstly, there is the time signature at the beginning of a\r\n      score. This time signature tells the player what the measures consists of. The top-digit tells how many beats there\r\n      are in the measure, the bottom-digit tells which note-value is equivalent to a beat. 4/4 is the time signature that\r\n      is most of the time started with to learn. What time signature 4/4 tells us: there are 4 beats where one beat is\r\n      equivalent to a quarter note. If the time signature was 2/8, each measure would consist of 2 beats where one beat is\r\n      quivalent to an eight note.</p>\r\n    <p>This information is important to understand the next section about different note-values. Since the note-values\r\n      will be explained with the time signature 4/4 in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Tempo</h2>\r\n    <p>Tempo is the measurement of time. Just like there exists meters and inches to measure the length of space, tempo\r\n      exists to measure time, where a minute is the base-value. A tempo is noted down as Beats Per Minute (BPM). Counting\r\n      in seconds is an example of a tempo with BPM 60. (There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 60 beats per minute). So if\r\n    tempo = 120 BPM, then there should be 120 beats in one minute.. By clapping 2 times in 1 second, we get 120 BPM)</p>\r\n  <p>Fun fact: did you know that the tempo represents the heart beat? When a person is in rest, it’s heart beat is\r\n    around 60 BPM. This BPM of “60” corresponds to the feeling of relaxed music. When the tempo goes up, i.e.: 120, then\r\n    the music feels more “energetic”. Dance music is (almost) always 120+. This way the heart gets more energetic, and\r\n    people might start to dance, too.</p>\r\n\r\n  <h2>Note-Value</h2>\r\n  <p>A note-value in music is just a representation to let the reading know how long the notes should be in proportion\r\n    to the tempo.</p>\r\n  <p>A note with an oval at the bottom (or top) and a line at the right side of this oval is called a quarter note. This\r\n    note has the note-value of 1 second, if the tempo is 60 BPM and the time signature is x/4. Note-values tells the\r\n    player the duration of a note. Next to the quarter note, there are also other note values, for instance: an eight\r\n    note. This note-value is twice as fast as a quarter note. So in 1 beat (or quarter note) there can be 2 eight notes.\r\n    So if the tempo = 60, and you know that one beat consists of 2 eight notes, then there 120 eight notes in total in\r\n    one minute.</p>\r\n  <p>We can also look at this with the “mathematical”-representation, a quarter note = ¼ note and an eight note = 1/8\r\n    note (the names are from the numbers). As stated before: “in 1 beat (or quarter note) there can be 2 eight notes.”,\r\n    which is correct: 1/8 + 1/8 = 2/8 = ¼.</p>\r\n  <p>The other note-values are just the same explanation. The basic notes (a quarter, half, whole, …) are representation\r\n    to learn by heart, from sixteenth notes, there is a mechanism to apply (just adding an extra line to the note, which\r\n    makes the value *2 faster), so an eight note has 1 line, a sixteenth note has 2 lines, a thirty-second-note has 3\r\n    lines, and so on have the corresponding values (1 * ¼ = 2 * 1/8 = 4 * 1/16 = 8 * 1/ 32 = …)</p>\r\n\r\n</div></template>\r\n  \r\n<style scoped></style>\r\n    ","import { render } from \"./Blog2019Practise.vue?vue&type=template&id=387cafd2\"\nconst script = {}\n\nimport exportComponent from \"../../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["exports","sfc","props","target","__vccOpts","key","val","_hoisted_1","_createElementBlock","_hoisted_14","script","__exports__","render"],"sourceRoot":""}
