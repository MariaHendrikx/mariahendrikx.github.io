It’s main goal is to let children and adults\r\n        practise, without them noticing it.\r\n      </p>\r\n  \r\n      <h2>Elements of Music</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        One way to practise music is to practise the music-elements seperately. A\r\n        list of these parameters are:\r\n      </p>\r\n      <ul class=\"ml-6\">\r\n        <li>Rhythm: note-value, tempo, duration</li>\r\n        <li>Pitch: pitch</li>\r\n        <li>Volume: Dynamics</li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Others: form, musical-direction, texture, metrum, harmony, timbre, …\r\n        </li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Dependent on what you are doing with music (composing vs. playing) some\r\n        elements are more important than others. When learning to play music from\r\n        a score: rhythm and pitch are elements that are mostly taught first, since\r\n        this is easily comprehended and it’s also the basis of musical scores.\r\n        When duration and pitch are played perfectly, the music sounds already\r\n        sort of pleasant to the ear. Although if the other elements are ignored…\r\n        listeners might get bored… (think about midi-files).\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Next to that: music with only the form-element but no rhythm or pitch\r\n        can’t really exist: since the form is derived from these elements. Except\r\n        John Cage's 4'33\", where there is no pitch or rhythm at all… but where the\r\n        form is in the timing.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Conclusion: music consists of separate elements that together make a\r\n        piece… a piece.\r\n      </p>\r\n  \r\n      <h2>Practise Music by Gaming</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        RedAndWhite Apps has made games to learn (and practise) the duration\r\n        (rhythm and tempo) element of music. Jump In Tempo for instance makes the\r\n        user tap the rhythm that is provided. It’s indeed possible to just\r\n        randomly tap in between a very long whole counting note. But in the brain\r\n        of the player, he is still “waiting” for the next note to come. The moment\r\n        of tapping is also kind of calculated.. since the player can’t tap way too\r\n        early nor too late, or he will hit the obstacle/note… At the same time,\r\n        the tempo is also trained: the obstacles are placed with tempo 60 in mind.\r\n        Since tempo 60 is a basic tempo, the player repeats this tempo-feeling\r\n        during the whole game. Once this tempo is mastered (by doing it a lot),\r\n        the player has a better reference feeling for other tempos. And best of\r\n        all: the concept of the game is a famous game-style: jump over and under\r\n        objects as far as you can… A proven real game-feel-like game! So the\r\n        player won’t even notice he is actually practising…\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        A game that focuses more on the tempo-training is tempo, tap it! Here the\r\n        tempo is displayed in the middle. The player has to tap accordingly. The\r\n        tapping is calculated mathematically, so it’s always correct. This way the\r\n        player gets immediately result if he was correct or not. The game is a\r\n        kind of ‘tester’.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Now… Why Jump in tempo or tempo, tap it! makes the player practise. As\r\n        mentioned before, one way to practise music is to practise elements\r\n        seperately. By practising it seperately, the mind focuses on that element\r\n        only. It’s much easier to focus on one thing only, then to focus on\r\n        everything… And as you may have noticed: music does contain a lot of\r\n        elements to take in mind! It’s (almost) impossible to get better at them\r\n        all at once. So, by training an element seperately, the mind focuses and\r\n        trains this element. When the player gets back to the whole picture, this\r\n        element has had it’s focus, so the player has a better understand of this\r\n        element in the music in general. It’s more “clear” now: we have one\r\n        element less to take care of. (Although a musician never really gets rid\r\n        of practising these elements….)\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        In the games mentioned, there is also made used of the music notation\r\n        musicians read with. This is also crucial to the practising. The music\r\n        notation lets the musician know what to play. It’s actually practising\r\n        this notation in relation with the duration of the note that the games are\r\n        focused on…\r\n      </p>\r\n  \r\n      <h2>Practise, practise, practise, …</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        “Practise makes perfect” is a sentence that is just the most correct\r\n        sentence that exist. Although, maybe there should be added: “if practised\r\n        correctly…” But in the end, the person that practises will get better. If\r\n        not: at some point he/she will notice that the way of practising isn’t\r\n        helping, and will eventually come to the correct way… Or he/she has given\r\n        up right after the point of the bad moment.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        But all these talented prodigies then? Or all these geniuses that are only\r\n        6 years old and have already mastered the level of a university degree?\r\n        Let’s tell you a secret: they practised, trained and learnt. They just\r\n        trained harder than the average kid… the outcome?: they got better and\r\n        better…\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The advantage these children (almost always) have, that (some) other kids\r\n        don’t have is: someone nearby who is an expert in the material. A problem\r\n        that a musician-student might have, is that they don’t know what rhythm is\r\n        and how to practise it. “A metronome is a musician’s best friend” they\r\n        say… but why??? A student might not know the relation with the tempo\r\n        (which is made clear by with the tick of the metronome) and the rhythm,\r\n        that the rhythm is something static in relation to the tempo, etc. If a\r\n        student doesn’t know this, it might practise the rhythm the completely\r\n        wrong way. For instance: not being accurate enough, or by mistaking the\r\n        note value, …\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        A game like Jump In Tempo can prevent this. Since rhythm and it’s notation\r\n        is just a measurement of time… it can be calculated. If it can be\r\n        calculated... a program can (probably) do it! A program is a very nice way\r\n        to do something and get feedback from it. In the game Jump In Tempo the\r\n        notation and timings are all correct, so by playing that game, the student\r\n        relates the correct timing with the correct note-value. A nice way to\r\n        practise correctly! And as stated before… “practise makes perfect”.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>So… what are you waiting for? Go practise!</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </template>\r\n  \r\n  <style scoped>\r\n \r\n  </style>\r\n    ","import { render } from \"./Blog2019RythmExplained.vue?vue&type=template&id=5490d93a\"\nconst script = {}\n\nimport exportComponent from \"../../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["exports","sfc","props","target","__vccOpts","key","val","_hoisted_1","_createElementBlock","_hoisted_20","script","__exports__","render"],"sourceRoot":""}
