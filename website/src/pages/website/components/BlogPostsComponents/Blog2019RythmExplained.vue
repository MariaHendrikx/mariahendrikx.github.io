        RedAndWhite Apps makes app to make children accustomed to musical theory
        in a game-style way. It’s main goal is to let children and adults
        practise, without them noticing it.

      <h2>Elements of Music</h2>
      <p>
        One way to practise music is to practise the music-elements seperately. A
        list of these parameters are:
      </p>
      <ul class="ml-6">
        <li>Rhythm: note-value, tempo, duration</li>
        <li>Pitch: pitch</li>
        <li>Volume: Dynamics</li>
        <li>
          Others: form, musical-direction, texture, metrum, harmony, timbre, …
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Dependent on what you are doing with music (composing vs. playing) some
        elements are more important than others. When learning to play music from
        a score: rhythm and pitch are elements that are mostly taught first, since
        this is easily comprehended and it’s also the basis of musical scores.
        When duration and pitch are played perfectly, the music sounds already
        sort of pleasant to the ear. Although if the other elements are ignored…
        listeners might get bored… (think about midi-files).
      </p>
      <p>
        Next to that: music with only the form-element but no rhythm or pitch
        can’t really exist: since the form is derived from these elements. Except
        John Cage's 4'33", where there is no pitch or rhythm at all… but where the
        form is in the timing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conclusion: music consists of separate elements that together make a
        piece… a piece.

      <h2>Practise Music by Gaming</h2>
      <p>
        RedAndWhite Apps has made games to learn (and practise) the duration
        (rhythm and tempo) element of music. Jump In Tempo for instance makes the
        user tap the rhythm that is provided. It’s indeed possible to just
        randomly tap in between a very long whole counting note. But in the brain
        of the player, he is still “waiting” for the next note to come. The moment
        of tapping is also kind of calculated.. since the player can’t tap way too
        early nor too late, or he will hit the obstacle/note… At the same time,
        the tempo is also trained: the obstacles are placed with tempo 60 in mind.
        Since tempo 60 is a basic tempo, the player repeats this tempo-feeling
        during the whole game. Once this tempo is mastered (by doing it a lot),
        the player has a better reference feeling for other tempos. And best of
        all: the concept of the game is a famous game-style: jump over and under
        objects as far as you can… A proven real game-feel-like game! So the
        player won’t even notice he is actually practising…
      </p>
      <p>
        A game that focuses more on the tempo-training is tempo, tap it! Here the
        tempo is displayed in the middle. The player has to tap accordingly. The
        tapping is calculated mathematically, so it’s always correct. This way the
        player gets immediately result if he was correct or not. The game is a
        kind of ‘tester’.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now… Why Jump in tempo or tempo, tap it! makes the player practise. As
        mentioned before, one way to practise music is to practise elements
        seperately. By practising it seperately, the mind focuses on that element
        only. It’s much easier to focus on one thing only, then to focus on
        everything… And as you may have noticed: music does contain a lot of
        elements to take in mind! It’s (almost) impossible to get better at them
        all at once. So, by training an element seperately, the mind focuses and
        trains this element. When the player gets back to the whole picture, this
        element has had it’s focus, so the player has a better understand of this
        element in the music in general. It’s more “clear” now: we have one
        element less to take care of. (Although a musician never really gets rid
        of practising these elements….)
      </p>
      <p>
        In the games mentioned, there is also made used of the music notation
        musicians read with. This is also crucial to the practising. The music
        notation lets the musician know what to play. It’s actually practising
        this notation in relation with the duration of the note that the games are
        focused on…
      </p>
  
      <h2>Practise, practise, practise, …</h2>
      <p>
        “Practise makes perfect” is a sentence that is just the most correct
        sentence that exist. Although, maybe there should be added: “if practised
        correctly…” But in the end, the person that practises will get better. If
        not: at some point he/she will notice that the way of practising isn’t
        helping, and will eventually come to the correct way… Or he/she has given
        up right after the point of the bad moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        But all these talented prodigies then? Or all these geniuses that are only
        6 years old and have already mastered the level of a university degree?
        Let’s tell you a secret: they practised, trained and learnt. They just
        trained harder than the average kid… the outcome?: they got better and
        better…
      </p>
      <p>
        The advantage these children (almost always) have, that (some) other kids
        don’t have is: someone nearby who is an expert in the material. A problem
        that a musician-student might have, is that they don’t know what rhythm is
        and how to practise it. “A metronome is a musician’s best friend” they
        say… but why??? A student might not know the relation with the tempo
        (which is made clear by with the tick of the metronome) and the rhythm,
        that the rhythm is something static in relation to the tempo, etc. If a
        student doesn’t know this, it might practise the rhythm the completely
        wrong way. For instance: not being accurate enough, or by mistaking the
        note value, …
      </p>
      <p>
        A game like Jump In Tempo can prevent this. Since rhythm and it’s notation
        is just a measurement of time… it can be calculated. If it can be
        calculated... a program can (probably) do it! A program is a very nice way
        to do something and get feedback from it. In the game Jump In Tempo the
        notation and timings are all correct, so by playing that game, the student
        relates the correct timing with the correct note-value. A nice way to
        practise correctly! And as stated before… “practise makes perfect”.
      </p>
      <p>So… what are you waiting for? Go practise!</p>
