    <h1>Rhythm explained</h1>
    <p>What is rhythm? Rhythm in music is basically just the timing of notes in relation to the tempo. Some say metrum,
      music-direction, music-feeling, .. are also part of the rhythm, but in music, it’s difficult to say what a term
      exactly means, since there are many definitions… When RedAndWhite Apps talks about rhythm, the duration of the notes
      is meant. The other elements, such as metrum, music-direction, … are seen as other elements of music, but not as a
      sub-category of rhythm. Music just doesn’t exist only by melody, rhythm, pitch, … There are so many elements to take
      in consideration, that it’s impossible to describe music by only 3-4 “main”-elements. There are some elements in
      music that are dependent on other elements though, such as metrum… metrum (the accent-placement in music) can only
      exist if there is rhythm. Since the metrum tells which counts to accentuate. But if there is no rhythm to
      accentuate… there is no rhythm nor metrum.</p>

    <h2>Time Signature</h2>
    <p>To visualize this metrum, a system has been create. Firstly, there is the time signature at the beginning of a
      score. This time signature tells the player what the measures consists of. The top-digit tells how many beats there
      are in the measure, the bottom-digit tells which note-value is equivalent to a beat. 4/4 is the time signature that
      is most of the time started with to learn. What time signature 4/4 tells us: there are 4 beats where one beat is
      equivalent to a quarter note. If the time signature was 2/8, each measure would consist of 2 beats where one beat is
      quivalent to an eight note.</p>
    <p>This information is important to understand the next section about different note-values. Since the note-values
      will be explained with the time signature 4/4 in mind.</p>

    <h2>Tempo</h2>
    <p>Tempo is the measurement of time. Just like there exists meters and inches to measure the length of space, tempo
      exists to measure time, where a minute is the base-value. A tempo is noted down as Beats Per Minute (BPM). Counting
      in seconds is an example of a tempo with BPM 60. (There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 60 beats per minute). So if
    tempo = 120 BPM, then there should be 120 beats in one minute.. By clapping 2 times in 1 second, we get 120 BPM)</p>
  <p>Fun fact: did you know that the tempo represents the heart beat? When a person is in rest, it’s heart beat is
    around 60 BPM. This BPM of “60” corresponds to the feeling of relaxed music. When the tempo goes up, i.e.: 120, then
    the music feels more “energetic”. Dance music is (almost) always 120+. This way the heart gets more energetic, and
    people might start to dance, too.</p>

  <h2>Note-Value</h2>
  <p>A note-value in music is just a representation to let the reading know how long the notes should be in proportion
    to the tempo.</p>
  <p>A note with an oval at the bottom (or top) and a line at the right side of this oval is called a quarter note. This
    note has the note-value of 1 second, if the tempo is 60 BPM and the time signature is x/4. Note-values tells the
    player the duration of a note. Next to the quarter note, there are also other note values, for instance: an eight
    note. This note-value is twice as fast as a quarter note. So in 1 beat (or quarter note) there can be 2 eight notes.
    So if the tempo = 60, and you know that one beat consists of 2 eight notes, then there 120 eight notes in total in
    one minute.</p>
  <p>We can also look at this with the “mathematical”-representation, a quarter note = ¼ note and an eight note = 1/8
    note (the names are from the numbers). As stated before: “in 1 beat (or quarter note) there can be 2 eight notes.”,
    which is correct: 1/8 + 1/8 = 2/8 = ¼.</p>
  <p>The other note-values are just the same explanation. The basic notes (a quarter, half, whole, …) are representation
    to learn by heart, from sixteenth notes, there is a mechanism to apply (just adding an extra line to the note, which
    makes the value *2 faster), so an eight note has 1 line, a sixteenth note has 2 lines, a thirty-second-note has 3
    lines, and so on have the corresponding values (1 * ¼ = 2 * 1/8 = 4 * 1/16 = 8 * 1/ 32 = …)</p>
