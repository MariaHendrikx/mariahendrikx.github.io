# A new blog: completely not finished

Today I was thinking to write about things I am grateful for in life. I am doubting to write about some struggles, but since I don't want to make a more negative post without rereading it at least twice, I like to focus on the positive.

# Why I am happy I studied 3 years of violin at a professional level

To be honest, I think I started studying violin "for the wrong reasons", societal wise. Personal wise, I think my reasons to study violin were really good. I studied violin, because I felt like I wasn't worth the compliments. During childhood, I got a lot of compliments for my violin in the violin world, from violin teachers and very skilled violinists. I knew that the compliments didn't mean that I was incredibly good, but more in a sense of: waw, you have an incredible amount of potential. This is also what annoyed me: I wasn't good, but had the potential to be really good, if I just practised. Practising was however incredibly difficult for me. I was very quick in learning when a teacher told me exactly what to do and they practised together with me. I was however horrible and didn't learn much when I was practising on my own. Furthermore, I didn't have the consistency to practise everyday. 

I was furthermore convinced, that if I had violin as my main focus, I would practise a lot. During high school, your studies are considered your main focus. Which is why I wasn't able to practise for violin. I thus decided to study violin at a professional level, such that I could make violin my main focus and finally be able to practise. Another very important reason I wanted to study violin, is because I never used scores in my life. When sheet music was placed before me, I thus also wasn't able to read it and even got very stressed from it. I was an analphabethiic person in music! I was incredibly annoyed that I wasn't able to read music. This really had to change... I just coudln't finish my violin years without being able to use scores.

So.. I started conservatory... However. Since I never really practised well, this was of course also hearable in my playing, plus also me not being able to read music... yeah, let's just summarize that my conservatory years were very hard..



I however, wasn't really good in my opinion. I felt like my skills were lacking a lot. On the other hand, I also had the feeling the compliments were more about "You have an incredible amount of potential", meaning they thought I wasn't necessarily good at the time, but I had a lot of potential to become incrediblly
