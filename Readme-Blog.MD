## Why use octokit for api request?
Octokit and Axios serve different purposes, so letâ€™s compare them:

Octokit:
GitHub-Specific: Octokit is designed specifically for interacting with GitHubâ€™s RESTful API. It provides an easy way to programmatically access GitHub features and data, such as repositories, issues, pull requests, and user profiles.
All-in-One: Octokit integrates three main libraries:
API client: Handles REST API requests, GraphQL API queries, and authentication.
App client: Manages GitHub Apps, installations, webhooks, and OAuth.
Action client: Pre-authenticated API client for single repositories.
GitHub Integration: If youâ€™re building GitHub-related features (like displaying repositories on a portfolio website), Octokit simplifies the process.
Axios:
General HTTP Client: Axios is a versatile HTTP client for making requests to any API, not just GitHub. Itâ€™s widely used in web development.
Not GitHub-Specific: Unlike Octokit, Axios doesnâ€™t have built-in GitHub-specific features.
Flexible: You can use Axios for various APIs, not just GitHub.
In summary, choose Octokit when working with GitHub data, and use Axios for general HTTP requests. ðŸ˜Š
